            The Scream (Norwegian: Skrik) is a series of four paintings by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, from 1893.
            The
            work depicts an androgynous figure in a moment of deep anguish and despair. The background is the dock of
            the
            Oslo Fjord (in Oslo) at sunset. The Scream is considered one of the most important works of the
            Expressionist
            movement and has acquired the status of a cultural icon, on a par with Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The
            series
            has four known paintings: two of the paintings in the series, "Anxiety" (Norwegian: Angst) and "Despair"
            (Norwegian: Fortvielse) are held by the Munch Museum in Oslo, another by the National Gallery in Oslo and
            another by a private collection. In 2012, the latter became the most expensive painting in history, selling
            for $119.9 million at auction.
            Using color to convey the intensity of feelings and disregarding the demands of verisimilitude in naturalist
            painting, Edvard Munch gave a personal interpretation of reality that paved the way for Expressionism.[14]
            The painter based his highly expressive style on Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh and Gauguin. The Scream was
            painted
            in Berlin, where Munch settled after the controversy caused by his paintings led to the Berlin Secession,
            but
            the influence of all three painters can still be felt. The painting is an image of the irrational fear we
            feel
            during a nightmare. Munch visualizes this experience without the aid of frightening apparitions, and it is
            for
            this reason that his work is more convincing.
